# Introduction

KODO is a platform that provides the protection both for workstations, laptops, tablets, mobile devices and smartphones. It ensures not only continued protection of key corporate data, but also sharing and migrating data to a new device.

KODO addresses desktop and mobile platforms: Windows, MacOS and Android, iOS and Windows Phone.

The safety and manageability are our biggest priorities. Magic links deployment, LDAP/Active Directory user management and webe based tools are the first step to help enterprises to manage difficult processes.

In order to ensure 100% safety, data are encrypted and all of your precious files are backuped right after saving them. The software does not wait for scheduled backup. It occurs automatically in the background as a system service. The administrator or authorized user defines the directories that require protection. The application compares all the gathered data when connecting to TSM server and if necessary performs a backup.
